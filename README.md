# REMIX 3BOX PLUGIN
A Remix plugin to access 3Box spaces

This plugin provides an interface for remix plugins to interact with 3Box spaces.

3Box provides private key-value storage linked to your eth address. Read more about it <a target=_blank href='https://docs.3box.io/api/storage'>https://docs.3box.io/api/storage</a>

Your plugin can basically call these functions if the user has activated the 3BOX plugin.

## Installation

Select the plugin in the sidebar and click 'Connect to metamax'. When it's connected you should see the logout button.

## Using it in your plugin

```
await client.call('box', 'openSpace', {})
```

Where client is your remix client.
